Instead, please send an email to dev[@]curii.com. 

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., remote code execution, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
