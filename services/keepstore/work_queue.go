/* A WorkQueue is an asynchronous thread-safe queue manager.  It
   provides a channel from which items can be read off the queue, and
   permits replacing the contents of the queue at any time.

   The overall work flow for a WorkQueue is as follows:

     1. A WorkQueue is created with NewWorkQueue().  This
        function instantiates a new WorkQueue and starts a manager
        goroutine.  The manager listens on an input channel
        (manager.newlist) and an output channel (manager.NextItem).

     2. The manager first waits for a new list of requests on the
        newlist channel.  When another goroutine calls
        manager.ReplaceQueue(lst), it sends lst over the newlist
        channel to the manager.  The manager goroutine now has
        ownership of the list.

     3. Once the manager has this initial list, it listens on both the
        input and output channels for one of the following to happen:

          a. A worker attempts to read an item from the NextItem
             channel.  The manager sends the next item from the list
             over this channel to the worker, and loops.

          b. New data is sent to the manager on the newlist channel.
             This happens when another goroutine calls
             manager.ReplaceItem() with a new list.  The manager
             discards the current list, replaces it with the new one,
             and begins looping again.

          c. The input channel is closed.  The manager closes its
             output channel (signalling any workers to quit) and
             terminates.

   Tasks currently handled by WorkQueue:
     * the pull list
     * the trash list

   Example usage:

        // Any kind of user-defined type can be used with the
        // WorkQueue.
		type FrobRequest struct {
			frob string
		}

		// Make a work list.
		froblist := NewWorkQueue()

		// Start a concurrent worker to read items from the NextItem
		// channel until it is closed, deleting each one.
		go func(list WorkQueue) {
			for i := range list.NextItem {
				req := i.(FrobRequest)
				frob.Run(req)
			}
		}(froblist)

		// Set up a HTTP handler for PUT /frob
		router.HandleFunc(`/frob`,
			func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
				// Parse the request body into a list.List
				// of FrobRequests, and give this list to the
				// frob manager.
				newfrobs := parseBody(req.Body)
				froblist.ReplaceQueue(newfrobs)
			}).Methods("PUT")

   Methods available on a WorkQueue:

		ReplaceQueue(list)
			Replaces the current item list with a new one.  The list
            manager discards any unprocessed items on the existing
            list and replaces it with the new one. If the worker is
            processing a list item when ReplaceQueue is called, it
            finishes processing before receiving items from the new
            list.
		Close()
			Shuts down the manager goroutine. When Close is called,
			the manager closes the NextItem channel.
