# You can use this configuration to run a development Node Manager for
# testing.  It uses libcloud's dummy driver and your own development API server.
# When new cloud nodes are created, you'll need to simulate the ping that
# they send to the Arvados API server.  The easiest way I've found to do that
# is through the API server Rails console: load the Node object, set its
# IP address to 10.10.0.N (where N is the cloud node's ID), and save.
