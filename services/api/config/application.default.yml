  uuid_prefix: ~

  # secret_token is a string of alphanumeric characters used by Rails

  ### Limits, timeouts and durations
  ###

  # Lifetime (in seconds) of blob permission signatures generated by
  # the API server. This determines how long a client can take (after
  # retrieving a collection record) to retrieve the collection data
  # from Keep. If the client needs more time than that (assuming the
  # collection still has the same content and the relevant user/token
  # still has permission) the client can retrieve the collection again
  # to get fresh signatures.
  #
  # This must be exactly equal to the -blob-signature-ttl flag used by
  # keepstore servers.  Otherwise, reading data blocks and saving
  # collections will fail with HTTP 403 permission errors.
  #
  # Modifying blob_signature_ttl invalidates existing signatures; see
  # blob_signing_key note above.
  #
  # The default is 2 weeks.
  blob_signature_ttl: 1209600

  # Default lifetime for ephemeral collections: 2 weeks. This must not
  # be less than blob_signature_ttl.
  default_trash_lifetime: 1209600

  # collections are marked as trash if their trash_at time has
  # arrived, and deleted if their delete_at time has arrived.
  trash_sweep_interval: 60

  # Maximum characters of (JSON-encoded) query parameters to include
  # in each request log entry. When params exceed this size, they will
  # be JSON-encoded, truncated to this size, and logged as

  max_request_log_params_size: 2000

  # Maximum size (in bytes) allowed for a single API request.  This

  # proxy to actually enforce the desired maximum request size on the

  max_request_size: 134217728

  # Limit the number of bytes read from the database during an index
  # request (by retrieving and returning fewer rows than would
  # normally be returned in a single response).
  # Note 1: This setting never reduces the number of returned rows to
  # zero, no matter how big the first data row is.
  # Note 2: Currently, this is only checked against a specific set of
