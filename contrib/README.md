This directory contains client libraries and tools that can be used with an Arvados cluster. Core components of Arvados are regularly tested together to ensure they work in concert. These tools receive less frequent testing before release. The Arvados team is happy to receive bug reports and contributions to help improve them. However, bugs in these components will never be considered release-critical.

* `arvbash`: Arvados utility functions for the bash shell

* `java-sdk-v2`: Java client SDK for Arvados

* `R-sdk`: R client SDK for Arvados
