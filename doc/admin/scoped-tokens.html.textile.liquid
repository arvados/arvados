By default, Arvados API tokens grant unlimited access to a user account, and admin account tokens have unlimited access to the whole system.  If you want to grant restricted access to a user account, you can create a "scoped token" which is an Arvados API token which is limited to accessing specific APIs.

One use of token scopes is to grant access to data, such as a collection, to users who do not have an Arvados accounts on your cluster.  This is done by creating scoped token that only allows getting a specific record.  An example of this is "creating a collection sharing link.":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/python/cookbook.html#sharing_link

Another example is situations where admin access is required but there is risk of the token being compromised.  Setting a scope prevents the token from being used for any action other than the specific action the token is intended for.  For example, "synchronizing user accounts on a shell node.":{{site.baseurl}}/install/install-shell-server.html#scoped-token

h2. Defining scopes

A "scope" consists of a HTTP method and API path.  A token can have multiple scopes.  Token scopes act as a whitelist, and the API server checks the HTTP method and the API path of every request against the scopes of the request token.  Scopes are also described on the "API Authorization":{{site.baseurl}}/api/tokens.html#scopes page of the "API documentation":{{site.baseurl}}/api .

These examples use @/arvados/v1/collections@, but can be applied to any endpoint.  Consult the "API documentation":{{site.baseurl}}/api to determine the endpoints for specific methods.

The scope @["GET", "/arvados/v1/collections"]@ will allow only GET or HEAD requests for the list of collections.  Any other HTTP method or path (including requests for a specific collection record, eg a request with path @/arvados/v1/collections/zzzzz-4zz18-0123456789abcde@) will return a permission error.

A trailing slash in a scope is signficant.  The scope @["GET", "/arvados/v1/collections/"]@ will allow only GET or HEAD requests *starting with* @/arvados/v1/collections/@.  A request for an individual record path @/arvados/v1/collections/zzzzz-4zz18-0123456789abcde@) is allowed but a request to list collections (@/arvados/v1/collections@) will be denied because it does not end with @/@ (API requests with a trailing @/@ will have the slash stripped before the scope is checked.)

The scope can include an object uuid.  The scope @["GET", "/arvados/v1/collections/zzzzz-4zz18-0123456789abcde"]@ only permits requests to read the record @zzzzz-4zz18-0123456789abcde@.

Since a token can have multiple scopes, use @[["GET", "/arvados/v1/collections"], ["GET", "/arvados/v1/collections/"]]@ to allow both listing collections and fetching individual collection records.  This will reject requests to create or change collections, or access any other API method.

Object create calls use the @POST@ method.  A scope of @["POST", "/arvados/v1/collections"]@ will allow creating collections, but not reading, listing or updating them (or accessing anything else).

Object update calls use the @PATCH@ method.  A scope of @["PATCH", "/arvados/v1/collections/"]@ will allow updating collections, but not listing or creating them.  (Note: while GET requests are denied an object can be read indirectly by using an empty PATCH which will return the unmodified object as the result).

Similarly, you can use a scope of @["PATCH", "/arvados/v1/collections/zzzzz-4zz18-0123456789abcde"]@ to restrict updates to a single collection.

There is one special exception to the scope rules: a valid token is always allowed to issue a request to "@GET /arvados/v1/api_client_authorizations/current@":{{ site.baseurl }}/api/methods/api_client_authorizations.html#current regardless of its scopes. This allows clients to reliably determine whether a request failed because a token is invalid, or because the token is not permitted to perform a particular request. The API server itself needs to be able to do this to validate tokens issued by other clusters in a federation.

h2. Creating a scoped token

A scoped token can be created at the command line:

<pre>
$ arv api_client_authorization create --api-client-authorization '{"scopes": [["GET", "/arvados/v1/collections"], ["GET", "/arvados/v1/collections/"]]}'
{
 "href":"/api_client_authorizations/x1u39-gj3su-bizbsw0mx5pju3w",
 "kind":"arvados#apiClientAuthorization",
 "etag":"9yk144t0v6cvyp0342exoh2vq",
 "uuid":"x1u39-gj3su-bizbsw0mx5pju3w",
 "owner_uuid":"x1u39-tpzed-fr97h9t4m5jffxs",
 "created_at":"2020-03-12T20:36:12.517375422Z",
 "modified_by_client_uuid":null,
 "modified_by_user_uuid":null,
 "modified_at":null,
 "user_id":3,
 "api_client_id":7,
 "api_token":"5a74htnoqwkhtfo2upekpfbsg04hv7cy5v4nowf7dtpxer086m",
 "created_by_ip_address":null,
 "default_owner_uuid":null,
 "expires_at":null,
 "last_used_at":null,
 "last_used_by_ip_address":null,
 "scopes":[
  [
   "GET",
   "/arvados/v1/collections"
  ],
  [
   "GET",
   "/arvados/v1/collections/"
  ]
 ]
}
</pre>

The response will include @api_token@ field which is the newly issued secret token.  It can be passed directly to the API server that issued it, or can be used to construct a @v2@ token.  A @v2@ format token is required if the token will be used to access other clusters in an Arvados federation.  An Arvados @v2@ format token consists of three fields separate by slashes: the prefix @v2@, followed by the token uuid, followed by the token secret.  For example: @v2/x1u39-gj3su-bizbsw0mx5pju3w/5a74htnoqwkhtfo2upekpfbsg04hv7cy5v4nowf7dtpxer086m@.
