To enable and collect health checks and metrics, services must be configured with a "management token".

Services must have ManagementToken configured.  This is used to authorize access monitoring endpoints.  If ManagementToken is not configured, monitoring endpoints will return the error @404 disabled@.

To access a monitoring endpoint, the requester must provide the HTTP header @Authorization: Bearer (ManagementToken)@.

h2. API server

Set @ManagementToken@ in the appropriate section of @application.yml@

<pre>
production:
  # Token to be included in all healthcheck requests. Disabled by default.
  # Server expects request header of the format "Authorization: Bearer xxx"
  ManagementToken: xxx
</pre>

h2. Node Manager

Set @port@ (the listen port) and @ManagementToken@ in the @Manage@ section of @node-manager.ini@.

<pre>
[Manage]
# The management server responds to http://addr:port/status.json with
# a snapshot of internal state.

# Management server listening address (default 127.0.0.1)
#address = 0.0.0.0

# Management server port number (default -1, server is disabled)
#port = 8989

ManagementToken = xxx
</pre>

h2. Other services

The following services also support monitoring.  Set @ManagementToken@ in the respective yaml config file for each service.

* keepstore
* keep-web
* keepproxy
* arv-git-httpd
* websockets
