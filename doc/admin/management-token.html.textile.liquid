To enable and collect health checks and metrics, services must be configured with a "management token".

Services must have ManagementToken configured.  This is used to authorize access monitoring endpoints.  If ManagementToken is not configured, monitoring endpoints will return the error @404 disabled@.

To access a monitoring endpoint, the requester must provide the HTTP header @Authorization: Bearer (ManagementToken)@.

h2. API server and other services

The following services also support monitoring.

* API server
* controller
* keep-balance
* keepproxy
* keepstore
* keep-web
* arvados-ws 

Set @ManagementToken@ in the appropriate section of @/etc/arvados/config.yml@.
