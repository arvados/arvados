h3. Common commands

Most @arv@ resources accept the following commands:

* @get@
* @list@
* @create@
* @update@
* @delete@


h4. @list@

Arguments accepted by the @list@ subcommand include:

<pre>
    --limit, -l <i>:     Maximum number of resources to return.
   --offset, -o <i>:     Number of users to skip before first returned record.
  --filters, -f <s>:     Conditions for filtering users.
    --order, -r <s>:     Order in which to return matching users.
   --select, -s <s>:     Select which fields to return
     --distinct, -d:     Return each distinct object
</pre>

The @--filters@ option takes a string describing a JSON list of filters on which the returned resources should be returned. Each filter is a three-element list of _[field, operator, value]_, where the _operator_ may be one of @=@, @<@, @<=@, @>@, @>=@, @!=@, @like@, or @ilike@.

Example:

@arv collection list --filters '[["name", "=", "PGP VAR inputs"], ["created_at", ">=", "2014-10-01"]]'@

will return a list of all collections visible to the current user which are named "PGP VAR inputs" and were created on or after October 1, 2014.
