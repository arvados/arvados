Beginning in version 2.7, Arvados now defaults to a new web application, referred to as "Workbench 2".  This is a major step in the migration from the classic web application, referred to as "Workbench 1".  Workbench 1 should be considered deprecated and suppport for the Workbench 1 application will be dropped in a future Arvados release.

Workbench 2 is the new Workbench web application that replaces Workbench 1. Workbench 2 is being built based on user feedback, and has feature parity with Workbench 1.  Workbench 2 has a modern look and feel and offers many advanced features and performance enhancements over the previous Workbench application.

To facilitate migration, Arvados may have both Workbench applications installed and have a dropdown menu option in the user menu to switch between versions.

Workbench 2 is stable and recommended for general use.  However, if you find that you need something in Workbench 1, you can easily switch back:
