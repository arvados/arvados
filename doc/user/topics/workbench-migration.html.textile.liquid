Beginning in version 2.7, Arvados now defaults to a new web application, referred to as "Workbench 2".  This is a major step in the migration from the classic web application, referred to as "Workbench 1".  Workbench 1 should be considered deprecated and suppport for the Workbench 1 application will be dropped in a future Arvados release.
