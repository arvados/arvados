h3. Upload

To upload a file to Keep using @arv keep put@:
<notextile>
<pre><code>~$ <span class="userinput">arv keep put var-GS000016015-ASM.tsv.bz2</span>
216M / 216M 100.0%
Collection saved as ...
qr1hi-4zz18-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
</code></pre>
</notextile>

The output value @qr1hi-4zz18-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ is the uuid of the Arvados collection created.

The file used in this example is a freely available TSV file containing variant annotations from "Personal Genome Project (PGP)":http://www.pgp-hms.org participant "hu599905.":https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu599905), downloadable "here":https://warehouse.pgp-hms.org/warehouse/f815ec01d5d2f11cb12874ab2ed50daa+234+K@ant/var-GS000016015-ASM.tsv.bz2.

<notextile><a name="dir"></a></notextile>It is also possible to upload an entire directory with @arv keep put@:

<notextile>
<pre><code>~$ <span class="userinput">mkdir tmp</span>
~$ <span class="userinput">echo "hello alice" > tmp/alice.txt</span>
~$ <span class="userinput">echo "hello bob" > tmp/bob.txt</span>
~$ <span class="userinput">echo "hello carol" > tmp/carol.txt</span>
~$ <span class="userinput">arv keep put tmp</span>
0M / 0M 100.0%
Collection saved as ...
qr1hi-4zz18-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
</code></pre>
</notextile>

In both examples, the @arv keep put@ command created a collection. The first collection contains the single uploaded file. The second collection contains the entire uploaded directory.

@arv keep put@ accepts quite a few optional command line arguments, which are described "on the arv subcommands":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/cli/subcommands.html#arv-keep-put page.

h3. Locate your collection in Workbench

Visit the Workbench *Dashboard*.  Click on *Projects*<span class="caret"></span> dropdown menu in the top navigation menu, select your *Home* project.  Your newly uploaded collection should appear near the top of the *Data collections* tab.  The collection locator printed by @arv keep put@ will appear under the *name* column.

To move the collection to a different project, check the box at the left of the collection row.  Pull down the *Selection...*<span class="caret"></span> menu near the top of the page tab, and select *Move selected*. This will open a dialog box where you can select a destination project for the collection.  Click a project, then finally the <span class="btn btn-sm btn-primary">Move</span> button.

Click on the *<i class="fa fa-fw fa-archive"></i> Show* button next to the collection's listing on a project page to go to the Workbench page for your collection.  On this page, you can see the collection's contents, download individual files, and set sharing options.
