The Arvados Workflow Composer is a graphical interface for building Common Workflow Language (CWL) workflows to run on Arvados.

This tutorial will demonstrate:

# Creating a new git repository through Arvados to store the workflow
# Creating CommandLineTools for "sort" and "uniq"
# Creating a Workflow which uses "sort" and "uniq" to remove duplicate lines from a text file
# Submitting the Workflow to run on Arvados
