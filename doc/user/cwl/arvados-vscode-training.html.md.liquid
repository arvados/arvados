These lessons give step by step instructions for using Visual Studio
Code (abbreviated "vscode") to develop CWL workflows on Arvados.

1. Set up SSH
1. Install vscode and necessary extensions
1. Use vscode to connect to an Arvados shell node for development
1. Create an simple command line tool, run it, and view the log
1. Upload input, create a command line tool to process it, and view the output

## 1. SSH Setup

1. (Windows only) Install git for windows [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
1. Open bash shell (installed with git for Windows)
   1. Shell: Run `ssh-keygen`
   1. Shell: Look for `Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/MyUsername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   1. Shell: Run `cat /c/Users/MyUsername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   1. Shell: Highlight and copy the lines starting with `ssh-rsa …`
1. Open Arvados workbench
   1. Workbench: Go to `SSH keys` in the user menu
   1. Workbench:Click `+Add new ssh key`
   1. Workbench: Paste the key into `Public key` and enter something for `name`
   1. Workbench: Go to `Virtual Machines` in the user menu
   1. Workbench: Highlight and copy the value in in the `Command line` column.
1. At the git bash command line
   1. Shell: paste the `ssh shell…` command line you got from workbench.
   1. Shell: type "yes" if it asks `do you want to continue connecting`
   1. Shell: You should now be logged into the Arvados shell node.  Note:
      it can take up to two minutes for the SSH key to be copied to
      the shell node.  If it doesn't work the first time, wait 60
      seconds and try again.
   1. Shell: Log out by typing `exit`

## 2. VSCode setup

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and start it up
1. Vscode: go to `Extensions`
   1. search for `remote development` and install the Remote Development extension pack from Microsoft
1. Vscode: On the left side bar, choose `Remote explorer`
   1. In the drop down, choose `SSH targets`
   1. Click `Add new`
   1. Enter the `ssh shell…` command line you used in the previous section, step 1.4.1
   1. Right click the ssh target in the list and select “connect to host in current window`
1. Vscode: go to `Extensions`
   1. Search for `benten` and install `CWL (Rabix/Benten)`
   1. Choose `Install extension on the remote ssh host`
1. Vscode: On the left side bar, choose `Explorer`
   1. Select `Clone Repository` and then enter [https://github.com/arvados/arvados-vscode-cwl-training](https://github.com/arvados/arvados-vscode-cwl-training)
   1. Choose `Open`
1. Go to Arvados Workbench
   1. Workbench: In the user menu, select `Current token`
   1. Vscode: Click on the `Terminal` menu
   1. Vscode: Click `Run Task…`
   1. Vscode: Select `Configure Arvados`
   1. Workbench: Copy the string following `ARVADOS_API_HOST=`
   1. Vscode: Paste the string at the `Value for ARVADOS_API_HOST` prompt
   1. Workbench: Copy the string following `ARVADOS_API_TOKEN=`
   1. Vscode: Paste the string at the `Value for ARVADOS_API_TOKEN` prompt

# 3. Register & run a workflow

1. Vscode: Click on the `lesson1/main.cwl` file
   1. Click on the `Terminal` menu
   1. Click `Run Task…`
   1. Select `Register or update CWL workflow on Arvados Workbench`
1. Workbench: Go to `+NEW` and select `New project`
   1. Enter a name for the project like "Lesson 1"
   1. You should arrive at the panel for the new project
1. Workbench: With `Lesson 1` selected
   1. Click on `+NEW` and select `Run a process`
   1. Select `CWL training lesson 1` from the list and click `Next`
   1. Enter a name for this run like `First training run`
   1. Enter a message (under `#main/message`) like "Hello world"
   1. Click `Run process`
   1. This should take you to a panel showing the workflow run status
1. Workbench: workflow run status panel
