These lessons give step by step instructions for using Visual Studio
Code (abbreviated "vscode") to develop CWL workflows on Arvados.

1. Set up SSH
1. Install vscode and necessary extensions, then use vscode to connect to an Arvados shell node for development
1. Register a workflow, run it on workbench, and view the log
1. Upload input, run a workflow on it, and view the output
1. Register a workflow with default inputs
1. Run a workflow without registering it

## 1. SSH Setup

1. (Windows only) Install Git for Windows [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   1. Choose "64-bit Git for Windows Setup".  It does not require admin privileges to install.
   1. Hit "Next" a bunch of times to accept the defaults
   1. The most important things is that "install git bash" and "install OpenSSH" are enabled (this is the default).
   1. At the end of the installation, you can launch tick a box to git bash directly.
   1. Open "Git Bash" (installed in the "Git" folder of the start menu)
1. (All operating systems) Starting from bash shell (on MacOS or Linux you will open "Terminal")
   1. Shell: Run `ssh-keygen`
      1. Hit enter to save to a default location
      1. You can choose to protect the key with a password, or just hit enter for no password.
   1. Shell: Look for a message like `Your public key has been saved
      in /c/Users/MyUsername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (Windows git bash
      example, on MacOS or Linux this will probably start with `/Users` or `/home`)
      1. Shell: Run `cat /c/Users/MyUsername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   1. Shell: Use the pointer to highlight and copy the lines starting
      with `ssh-rsa …` up to the next blank line.  Right click and
      select "Copy"
1. Open Arvados workbench 2.  If necessary, go to the user menu and
   select "Go to Workbench 2"
   1. Workbench: Go to `SSH keys` in the user menu
   1. Workbench:Click `+Add new ssh key`
   1. Workbench: Paste the key into `Public key` and enter something for `name`
   1. Workbench: Go to `Virtual Machines` in the user menu
   1. Workbench: Highlight and copy the value in in the `Command line` column.
1. At the git bash command line
   1. Shell: paste the `ssh shell…` command line you got from workbench.
   1. Shell: type "yes" if it asks `Are you sure you want to continue connecting`.
   1. Note: it can take up to two minutes for the SSH key to be copied to
      the shell node.  If you get "Permission denied" the first time, wait 60
      seconds and try again.
   1. Shell: You should now be logged into the Arvados shell node.
   1. Shell: Log out by typing `exit`

## 2. VSCode setup

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and start it up
1. Vscode: On the left sidebar, select `Extensions` ![](images/Extensions.png)

   1. Click `Add New` ![](images/AddNew.png)
   1. Enter the `ssh shell…` command line you used in the previous section, step 1.4.1
      1. If it asks you `Select SSH configuration file to update` choose the first one in the list.
   1. Right click the newly added ssh target in the list and select “connect to host in current window`
   1. If it asks `Select platform of the remote host` select `Linux`.
1. Vscode: On the left sidebar, go back to `Extensions` ![](images/Extensions.png)

## Notes

If you need to change something about the environment of the user on
the remote host (for example, the user has been added to a new unix
group) you need to restart the vscode server that runs on the remote
host.  Do this in vscode:

ctrl+shift+p: `Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host`

This is because the vscode server remains running on the remote host
even after you disconnect, so exiting/restarting vscode on the desktop
has no effect.
