h3(#Services). Services

Located in @arvados/services@.  Many services have been incorporated into @arvados-server@, see below.

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Component|_. Description|
|api|Along with Controller, the API server is the core of Arvados.  It is backed by a Postgres database and manages information such as metadata for storage, a record of submitted compute jobs, users, groups, and associated permissions.|
|crunch-dispatch-local|Get compute requests submitted to the API server and execute them locally.|
|dockercleaner|Daemon for cleaning up Docker containers and images.|
|fuse|Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) enabling users to mount Keep collections as a filesystem.|
|login-sync|Synchronize virtual machine users with Arvados users and permissions.|
|workbench2|Web application providing user interface to Arvados services.|

h3(#Arvados-server). Arvados-server

Located in @cmd/arvados-server@.  It consists of a single @arvados-server@ binary with a number of different subcommands.  Although the binary itself is monolithic, subcommands are each a standalone service and only handle requests for that specific service, i.e. a @arvados-server controller@ process will not respond to requests intended for a @arvados-server keep-web@.

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Subcommand|_. Description |
|boot|Boot an Arvados cluster from source, used by automated testing.|
|check|Contact the a health check endpoint on services and print a report.|
|cloudtest|Diagnostic tool which attempts to start a cloud instance using the current settings in the config file.|
|config-check|Check that the config file is valid.|
|config-defaults|Dump the default config options.|
|config-dump|Dump the active config options that would be used by the other @arvados-server@ commands.|
|controller|Controller works with the API server to make up the core of Arvados.  It intercepts requests and implements additional features such as federation.|
|crunch-run|Dispatched by crunch-dispatch, executes a single compute run: setting up a Docker container, running it, and collecting the output.|
|crunchstat|Run a program and collect resource usage stats using cgroups.|
|dispatch-cloud|Get compute requests submitted to the API server and schedule them on elastic cloud compute, creating and destroying cloud based virtual machines on demand.|
|dispatch-lsf|Get compute requests submitted to the API server and submit them to LSF HPC scheduler.|
|dispatch-slurm|Get compute requests submitted to the API server and submit them to SLURM HPC scheduler.|
|health|Service that aggregates the other health check results to provide a single cluster-wide health status.|
|install|Install development dependencies to be able to build and run Arvados from source.|
|init|Do initial configuration and database setup in order to run the @boot@ subcommand.|
|keep-balance|Perform storage utilization reporting, optimization and garbage collection.  Moves data blocks to their optimum location, ensures correct replication and storage class, and trashes unreferenced blocks.|
|keep-web|Provides high-level to files in collections as either a WebDAV or S3-compatible API endpoint.|
|keepproxy|Provides low-level access to keepstore services (block-level data access) for clients outside the internal (private) network.|
|keepstore|Provides access to underlying storage (filesystem or object storage such as Amazon S3 or Azure Blob) with Arvados permissions.|
|recover-collection|This program recovers deleted collections. Recovery is possible when the collection's manifest is still available and all of its data blocks are still available or recoverable.|
|workbench2|Serve the HTML/Javascript for the single-page Workbench application.|
|ws|Publishes API server change events over websockets.|

h3(#SDK). SDK

The @arv@ command is located in @arvados/sdk/ruby@, the @arv-*@ tools are located in @arvados/sdk/python@.

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Component|_. Description |
|arv|Provides command line access to API, also provides some purpose utilities.|
|arv-copy|Copy a collection from one cluster to another|
|arv-get|Get files from a collection.|
|arv-keepdocker|Upload Docker images from local Docker daemon to Keep.|
|arv-ls|List files in a collection|
|arv-put|Upload files to a collection.|
|arv-ws|Print events from Arvados websocket event source.|

h3(#Tools). Tools

Located in @arvados/tools@.

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Component|_. Description |
|arvbash|Helpful @bash@ macros for using Arvados at the command line.|
|arvbox|Dockerized Arvados environment for development and testing.|
|cluster-activity|Generate a HTML and/or CSV report of cluster activity over a time period.|
|crunchstat-summary|Read execution metrics (cpu %, ram, network, etc) collected from a compute container and produce a report.|
|keep-block-check|Given a list of keep block locators, check that each block exists on one of the configured keepstore servers and verify the block hash.|
|keep-exercise|Benchmarking tool to test throughput and reliability of keepstores under various usage patterns.|
|keep-rsync|Get lists of blocks from two clusters, copy blocks which exist on source cluster but are missing from destination cluster.|
|sync-groups|Takes a CSV file listing with rows in the form (group, user, permission) records and synchronize membership in Arvados groups.|
|sync-users|Takes a CSV file listing with rows in the form (email, first name, last name, active, admin) and synchronize Arvados users.|
|user-activity|Generate a text report of user activity over a time period.|

h3(#Arvados-client). Arvados-client

Located in @cmd/arvados-client@.  It consists of a single @arvados-client@ binary with a number of different subcommands.

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Subcommand|_. Description |
|connect-ssh|Connects stdin/stdout to a container's gateway server. It is intended to be invoked with OpenSSH client's ProxyCommand config.|
|deduplication-report|This program analyzes the overlap in blocks used by 2 or more collections. It prints a deduplication report that shows the nominal space used by the collections, as well as the actual size and the amount of space that is saved by Keep's deduplication.|
|diagnostics|Perform cluster diagnostics to check that all the services are available and responding normally to requests.|
|logs|Prints live streaming logs for a container.|
|mount|Alternate Keep FUSE mount written in Go.|
|shell|Connects the terminal to an interactive shell on a running container.|
|sudo|Runs another command using API connection info and SystemRootToken from the system config file instead of the caller's environment vars.|
