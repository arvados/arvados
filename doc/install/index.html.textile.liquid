Arvados components run on GNU/Linux systems, and do not depend on any particular cloud operating stack.  Arvados supports Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, as well as Red Hat and derivatives such as CentOS.

Arvados components can be installed and configured in a number of different ways.  Step-by-step instructions are available to perform a production installation from packages with manual configuration.  This method assumes you have several (virtual) machines at your disposal for running the various Arvados components.
