h2. arvbox is unsupported

The Arvados team does not maintain or support arvbox as of Arvados 3.2.0.

If you were using arvbox in demo mode, consider installing on a Debian-based virtual machine with our "single-node Ansible installer":{{ site.baseurl }}/install/install-single-host.html.

If you were using arvbox for development, we now provide an Ansible playbook to install development dependencies on a Debian-based system. Our "Hacking Prerequisites wiki":https://dev.arvados.org/projects/arvados/wiki/Hacking_prerequisites has instructions for how to use it.

Installing systems with Ansible requires a little more initial setup, but once you've done that, it's easier to keep a system up-to-date: when you want to update a system, you simply re-run the playbook. We think this trade-off lets us provide a better experience to a wider variety of users.
