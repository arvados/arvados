This page describes the requirements for a compute node in a Slurm or LSF cluster that will run containers dispatched by @crunch-dispatch-slurm@ or @arvados-dispatch-lsf@. If you are installing a cloud cluster, refer to "Build a cloud compute node image":/install/crunch2-cloud/install-compute-node.html.

h2(#introduction). Introduction

This page describes how to configure a compute node so that it can be used to run containers dispatched by Arvados, with Slurm on a static cluster. These steps must be performed on every compute node.
