Arvados on Kubernetes is implemented as a @Helm 3@ chart.

h2(#overview). Overview

This Helm chart provides a basic, small Arvados cluster.

Current limitations, to be addressed in the future:

* An Arvados cluster created with this Helm chart is entirely ephemeral, and all data stored on the cluster will be deleted when it is shut down.
* No dynamic scaling of compute nodes (but you can adjust @values.yaml@ and reload the Helm chart)
* All compute nodes are the same size
* Compute nodes have no cpu/memory/disk constraints yet
* No git server

h2. Requirements

* Minikube or Google Kubernetes Engine (Kubernetes 1.10+ with at least 3 nodes, 2+ cores per node)
* @kubectl@ and @Helm 3@ installed locally, and able to connect to your Kubernetes cluster

Please refer to "Arvados on Minikube":{{ site.baseurl }}/install/arvados-on-kubernetes-minikube.html or "Arvados on GKE":{{ site.baseurl }}/install/arvados-on-kubernetes-GKE.html for detailed installation instructions.
