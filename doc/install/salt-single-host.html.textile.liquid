h2(#limitations). Limitations of the single host install

<b>NOTE: The single host installation is a good choice for evaluating Arvados, but it is not recommended for production use.</b>

Using the default configuration, this installation method has a number of limitations:

* all services run on the same machine, and they will compete for resources. This includes any compute jobs.
* it uses the local machine disk for Keep storage (under the @/tmp@ directory). There may not be a lot of space available.
* it installs the @crunch-dispatch-local@ dispatcher, which can run just eight concurrent CWL jobs. These jobs will be executed on the same machine that runs all the Arvados services and may well starve them of resources.

It is possible to start with the single host installation method and modify the Arvados configuration file later to address these limitations. E.g. switch to a "different storage volume setup":{{site.baseurl}}/install/configure-s3-object-storage.html for Keep, and switch to "the cloud dispatcher":{{site.baseurl}}/install/crunch2-cloud/install-dispatch-cloud.html to provision compute resources dynamically.

h2(#prerequisites). Prerequisites and planning

Prerequisites:

* git
* a dedicated (virtual) machine for your Arvados server with at least 2 cores and 8 GiB of RAM, running a "supported Arvados distribution":{{site.baseurl}}/install/install-manual-prerequisites.html#supportedlinux
* at least one DNS hostname that resolves to the IP address of your Arvados server
* ports 443, 9443-9445, 11002, 14202, 18002, 35101 need to be reachable from your client (configurable, see below)
* port 80 needs to be reachable from everywhere on the internet (only when using "Let's Encrypt":#lets-encrypt)
* one or more SSL certificates matching the hostname(s) in use (only when using "bring your own certificate(s)":#bring-your-own)

h2(#single_host). Single host install using the provision.sh script

{% include 'branchname' %}

This procedure will install all the main Arvados components to get you up and running in a single host.

This is a package-based installation method, however the installation script is currently distributed in source form via @git@:

<notextile>
<pre><code>git clone https://git.arvados.org/arvados.git
git checkout {{ branchname }}
cd arvados/tools/salt-install
</code></pre>
</notextile>

The @provision.sh@ script will help you deploy Arvados by preparing your environment to be able to run the installer, then running it. The actual installer is located in the "arvados-formula git repository":https://git.arvados.org/arvados-formula.git/tree/refs/heads/{{ branchname }} and will be cloned during the running of the @provision.sh@ script.  The installer is built using "Saltstack":https://saltproject.io/ and @provision.sh@ performs the install using master-less mode.

After setting up a few variables in a config file (next step), you'll be ready to run it and get Arvados deployed.

h2(#choose_configuration). Choose the desired configuration

Arvados' single host installation can be done in two ways:

* Using a single hostname, assigning <i>a different port (other than 443) for each user-facing service</i>: This choice is easier to setup, but the user will need to know the port/s for the different services she wants to connect to.
* Using multiple hostnames on the same IP: this setup involves a few extra steps but each service will have a meaningful hostname so it will make easier to access them later.

Once you decide which of these choices you prefer, copy one the two example configuration files and directory, and edit them to suit your needs.

h3(#single_host_single_hostname). Single host / single hostname
<notextile>
<pre><code>cp local.params.example.single_host_single_hostname local.params
cp -r config_examples/single_host/single_hostname local_config_dir
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Edit the variables in the <i>local.params</i> file. Pay attention to the <b>*_PORT, *_TOKEN</b> and <b>*KEY</b> variables.

h3(#single_host_multiple_hostnames). Single host / multiple hostnames (Alternative configuration)
<notextile>
<pre><code>cp local.params.example.single_host_multiple_hostnames local.params
cp -r config_examples/single_host/multiple_hostnames local_config_dir
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Edit the variables in the <i>local.params</i> file.

h2(#certificates). Choose the SSL configuration (SSL_MODE)

Arvados requires SSL certificates to work correctly. This installer supports these options:

* @self-signed@: let the installer create self-signed certificate(s)
* @lets-encrypt@: automatically obtain and install SSL certificates for your hostname(s)
* @bring-your-own@: supply your own certificate(s) in the `certs` directory

h3(#self-signed). Using self-signed certificates

In the default configuration, this installer uses self-signed certificate(s):

<notextile>
<pre><code>SSL_MODE="self-signed"
</code></pre>
</notextile>

When connecting to the Arvados web interface for the first time, you will need to accept the self-signed certificate as trusted to bypass the browser warnings.

h3(#lets-encrypt). Using Let's Encrypt certificates

To automatically get (a) valid certificate(s) via Let's Encrypt, change the configuration like this:

<notextile>
<pre><code>SSL_MODE="lets-encrypt"
</code></pre>
</notextile>

It is important that the DNS hostnames defined in the configuration resolve to the Arvados instance(s), so that Let's Encrypt can validate the domainname ownership and issue the certificate(s).

When using AWS, EC2 instances can have a default hostname that ends with `amazonaws.com`. Let's Encrypt has a blacklist of domain names for which it will not issue certificates, and that blacklist includes the `amazonaws.com` domain, which means the default hostname can not be used to get a certificate from Let's Encrypt.

For a @single hostname@ setup, the hostname must be defined in @HOSTNAME_EXT@ and resolve to the IP address of your Arvados instance.

For a @multiple hostnames@ setup, the hostnames are created by combining the values of @CLUSTER@ and @DOMAIN@ from the configuration with a prefix. These hostnames must resolve to the IP address of your Arvados instance:

* @CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@
* ws.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@
* workbench.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@
* workbench2.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@
* webshell.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@
* download.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@
* collections.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@
* keep.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@

h3(#bring-your-own). Using your own certificates

To supply your own certificates, change the configuration like this:

<notextile>
<pre><code>SSL_MODE="bring-your-own"
CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR="${SCRIPT_DIR}/certs"
</code></pre>
</notextile>

{% include 'install_custom_certificates' %}

h3(#further_customization). Further customization of the installation (modifying the salt pillars and states)

If you want or need further customization, you can edit the Saltstack pillars and states files. Pay particular attention to the <i>pillars/arvados.sls</i> one. Any extra <i>state</i> file you add under <i>local_config_dir/states</i> will be added to the salt run and applied to the host.

h2(#run_provision_script). Run the provision.sh script

When you finished customizing the configuration, you are ready to copy the files to the host (if needed) and run the @provision.sh@ script:

<notextile>
<pre><code>scp -r provision.sh local* tests user@host:
# if you are using bring-your-own certificates, make sure to copy those too:
# scp -r certs user@host:
ssh user@host sudo ./provision.sh
</code></pre>
</notextile>

or, if you saved the @local.params@ in another directory or with some other name

<notextile>
<pre><code>scp -r provision.sh local* tests user@host:
ssh user@host sudo ./provision.sh -c /path/to/your/local.params.file
</code></pre>
</notextile>

and wait for it to finish. The script will need 5 to 10 minutes to install and configure everything.

If everything goes OK, you'll get some final lines stating something like:

<notextile>
<pre><code>arvados: Succeeded: 109 (changed=9)
arvados: Failed:      0
</code></pre>
</notextile>

h2(#final_steps). Final configuration steps

Once the deployment went OK, you'll need to perform a few extra steps in your local browser/host to access the cluster.

h3(#ca_root_certificate). Install the CA root certificate (SSL_MODE=self-signed only)

Arvados uses SSL to encrypt communications. Its UI uses AJAX which will silently fail if the certificate is not valid or signed by an unknown Certification Authority.

For this reason, the @arvados-formula@ has a helper state to create a root certificate to authorize Arvados services. The @provision.sh@ script will leave a copy of the generated CA's certificate (@arvados-snakeoil-ca.pem@) in the script's directory so you can add it to your workstation.

Installing the root certificate into your web browser will prevent security errors when accessing Arvados services with your web browser.

# Go to the certificate manager in your browser.
#* In Chrome, this can be found under "Settings &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Manage Certificates" or by entering @chrome://settings/certificates@ in the URL bar.
#* In Firefox, this can be found under "Preferences &rarr; Privacy & Security" or entering @about:preferences#privacy@ in the URL bar and then choosing "View Certificates...".
# Select the "Authorities" tab, then press the "Import" button.  Choose @arvados-snakeoil-ca.pem@

The certificate will be added under the "Arvados Formula".

To access your Arvados instance using command line clients (such as arv-get and arv-put) without security errors, install the certificate into the OS certificate storage.

* On Debian/Ubuntu:

<notextile>
<pre><code>cp arvados-root-cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
/usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
</code></pre>
</notextile>

* On CentOS:

<notextile>
<pre><code>cp arvados-root-cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
/usr/bin/update-ca-trust
</code></pre>
</notextile>

h3(#single_host_multiple_hostnames_dns_configuration). Local DNS configuration (multiple hostnames only)

When using multiple hostnames, you need to set up your DNS to be able to access the cluster.

If you don't have access to the domain's DNS to add the required entries, the simplest way to do it is to edit your @/etc/hosts@ file (as root). Change @CLUSTER@, @DOMAIN@ and @HOST_IP@ to your local values:

<notextile>
<pre><code>export CLUSTER="arva2"
export DOMAIN="arv.local"
export HOST_IP="127.0.0.2"    # This is valid either if installing in your computer directly
                              # or in a Vagrant VM. If you're installing it on a remote host
                              # just change the IP to match that of the host.
echo "${HOST_IP} api keep keep0 collections download ws workbench workbench2 ${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} api.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} keep.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} keep0.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} collections.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} download.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} ws.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} workbench.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} workbench2.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN}" >> /etc/hosts
</code></pre>
</notextile>

h2(#initial_user). Initial user and login

At this point you should be able to log on to your new Arvados cluster.

For a @single hostname@ setup, the workbench URL will be

* https://@HOSTNAME_EXT@

For a @multiple hostnames@ setup, the workbench URL will be

* https://workbench.@CLUSTER@.@DOMAIN@

By default, the provision script creates an initial user for testing purposes. This user is configured as administrator of the newly created cluster. The username, password and e-mail address for the initial user are configured in the @local.params@ file.

h2(#test_install). Test the installed cluster running a simple workflow

The @provision.sh@ script saves a simple example test workflow in the @/tmp/cluster_tests@ directory in the node. If you want to run it, just ssh to the node, change to that directory and run:

<notextile>
<pre><code>cd /tmp/cluster_tests
sudo ./run-test.sh
</code></pre>
</notextile>

It will create a test user (by default, the same one as the admin user), upload a small workflow and run it. If everything goes OK, the output should similar to this (some output was shortened for clarity):

h2(#post_install). After the installation

Once the installation is complete, it is recommended to keep a copy of your local configuration files. Committing them to version control is a good idea.

Re-running the Salt-based installer is not recommended for maintaining and upgrading Arvados, please see "Maintenance and upgrading":{{site.baseurl}}/admin/maintenance-and-upgrading.html for more information.
