h2(#single_host). Single host install using the provision.sh script

<b>NOTE: The single host installation is not recommended for production use.</b>

{% include 'branchname' %}

This is a package-based installation method. Start with the @provision.sh@ script which is available by cloning the @{{ branchname }}@ branch from "https://git.arvados.org/arvados.git":https://git.arvados.org/arvados.git .  The @provision.sh@ script and its supporting files can be found in the "arvados/tools/salt-install":https://git.arvados.org/arvados.git/tree/refs/heads/{{ branchname }}:/tools/salt-install directory in the Arvados git repository.

This procedure will install all the main Arvados components to get you up and running in a single host. The whole installation procedure takes somewhere between 15 to 60 minutes, depending on the host resources and its network bandwidth. As a reference, on a virtual machine with 1 core and 1 GB RAM, it takes ~25 minutes to do the initial install.

The @provision.sh@ script will help you deploy Arvados by preparing your environment to be able to run the installer, then running it. The actual installer is located at "arvados-formula":https://git.arvados.org/arvados-formula.git/tree/refs/heads/{{ branchname }} and will be cloned during the running of the @provision.sh@ script.  The installer is built using "Saltstack":https://saltproject.io/ and @provision.sh@ performs the install using master-less mode.

After setting up a few variables in a config file (next step), you'll be ready to run it and get Arvados deployed.

h2(#choose_configuration). Choose the desired configuration

For documentation's sake, we will use the cluster name <i>arva2</i> and the domain <i>arv.local</i>. If you don't change them as required in the next steps, installation won't proceed.

Arvados' single host installation can be done in two fashions:

* Using a single hostname, assigning <i>a different port (other than 443) for each user-facing service</i>: This choice is easier to setup, but the user will need to know the port/s for the different services she wants to connect to.
* Using multiple hostnames on the same IP: this setup involves a few extra steps but each service will have a meaningful hostname so it will make easier to access them later.

Once you decide which of these choices you prefer, copy one the two example configuration files and directory, and edit them to suit your needs.

h3(#single_host_single_hostnames). Single host / single hostname
<notextile>
<pre><code>cp local.params.example.single_host_single_hostname local.params
cp -r config_examples/single_host/single_hostname local_config_dir
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Edit the variables in the <i>local.params</i> file. Pay attention to the <b>*_PORT, *_TOKEN</b> and <b>*KEY</b> variables.

The <i>single_host</i> examples use self-signed SSL certificates, which are deployed using the same mechanism used to deploy custom certificates.

If you plan to use custom certificates, please set the variable <i>USE_LETSENCRYPT=no</i> and copy your certificates to the directory specified with the variable @CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR@ (usually "./certs") in the remote directory where you copied the @provision.sh@ script. From this dir, the provision script will install the certificates required for the role you're installing.

The script expects cert/key files with these basenames (matching the role except for <i>keepweb</i>, which is split in both <i>download / collections</i>):

* "controller"
* "websocket"
* "workbench"
* "workbench2"
* "webshell"
* "download"         # Part of keepweb
* "collections"      # Part of keepweb
* "keepproxy"

Ie., for 'keepproxy', the script will lookup for

<notextile>
<pre><code>${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.crt
${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.key
</code></pre>
</notextile>

If you want to use valid certificates provided by LetsEncrypt, please set the variable <i>USE_LETSENCRYPT=yes</i> and make sure that all the FQDNs that you will use for the public-facing applications (API/controller, Workbench, Keepproxy/Keepweb) are reachable.

h3(#single_host_multiple_hostnames). Single host / multiple hostnames (Alternative configuration)
<notextile>
<pre><code>cp local.params.example.single_host_multiple_hostnames local.params
cp -r config_examples/single_host/multiple_hostnames local_config_dir
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Edit the variables in the <i>local.params</i> file.

h3(#further_customization). Further customization of the installation (modifying the salt pillars and states)

If you want or need further customization, you can edit the Saltstack pillars and states files. Pay particular attention to the <i>pillars/arvados.sls</i> one. Any extra <i>state</i> file you add under <i>local_config_dir/states</i> will be added to the salt run and applied to the host.

h2(#run_provision_script). Run the provision.sh script

When you finished customizing the configuration, you are ready to copy the files to the host (if needed) and run the @provision.sh@ script:

<notextile>
<pre><code>scp -r provision.sh local* tests user@host:
ssh user@host sudo ./provision.sh
</code></pre>
</notextile>

or, if you saved the @local.params@ in another directory or with some other name

<notextile>
<pre><code>scp -r provision.sh local* tests user@host:
ssh user@host sudo ./provision.sh -c /path/to/your/local.params.file
</code></pre>
</notextile>

and wait for it to finish.

If everything goes OK, you'll get some final lines stating something like:

<notextile>
<pre><code>arvados: Succeeded: 109 (changed=9)
arvados: Failed:      0
</code></pre>
</notextile>

h2(#final_steps). Final configuration steps

Once the deployment went OK, you'll need to perform a few extra steps in your local browser/host to access the cluster.

h3(#ca_root_certificate). Install the CA root certificate (required in both alternatives)

Arvados uses SSL to encrypt communications. Its UI uses AJAX which will silently fail if the certificate is not valid or signed by an unknown Certification Authority.

For this reason, the @arvados-formula@ has a helper state to create a root certificate to authorize Arvados services. The @provision.sh@ script will leave a copy of the generated CA's certificate (@arvados-snakeoil-ca.pem@) in the script's directory so you can add it to your workstation.

Installing the root certificate into your web browser will prevent security errors when accessing Arvados services with your web browser.

# Go to the certificate manager in your browser.
#* In Chrome, this can be found under "Settings &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Manage Certificates" or by entering @chrome://settings/certificates@ in the URL bar.
#* In Firefox, this can be found under "Preferences &rarr; Privacy & Security" or entering @about:preferences#privacy@ in the URL bar and then choosing "View Certificates...".
# Select the "Authorities" tab, then press the "Import" button.  Choose @arvados-snakeoil-ca.pem@

The certificate will be added under the "Arvados Formula".

To access your Arvados instance using command line clients (such as arv-get and arv-put) without security errors, install the certificate into the OS certificate storage.

* On Debian/Ubuntu:

<notextile>
<pre><code>cp arvados-root-cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
/usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates
</code></pre>
</notextile>

* On CentOS:

<notextile>
<pre><code>cp arvados-root-cert.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
/usr/bin/update-ca-trust
</code></pre>
</notextile>

h3(#single_host_multiple_hostnames_dns_configuration). DNS configuration (single host / multiple hostnames)

When using multiple hostnames, after the setup is done, you need to set up your DNS to be able to access the cluster.

If you don't have access to the domain's DNS to add the required entries, the simplest way to do it is to edit your @/etc/hosts@ file (as root):

<notextile>
<pre><code>export CLUSTER="arva2"
export DOMAIN="arv.local"
export HOST_IP="127.0.0.2"    # This is valid either if installing in your computer directly
                              # or in a Vagrant VM. If you're installing it on a remote host
                              # just change the IP to match that of the host.
echo "${HOST_IP} api keep keep0 collections download ws workbench workbench2 ${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} api.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} keep.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} keep0.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} collections.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} download.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} ws.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} workbench.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} workbench2.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN}" >> /etc/hosts
</code></pre>
</notextile>

h2(#initial_user). Initial user and login

At this point you should be able to log into the Arvados cluster. The initial URL will be:

* https://workbench.arva2.arv.local

or, in general, the url format will be:

* https://workbench.@<cluster>.<domain>@

By default, the provision script creates an initial user for testing purposes. This user is configured as administrator of the newly created cluster.

Assuming you didn't change these values in the @local.params@ file, the initial credentials are:

* User: 'admin'
* Password: 'password'
* Email: 'admin@arva2.arv.local'

h2(#test_install). Test the installed cluster running a simple workflow

The @provision.sh@ script saves a simple example test workflow in the @/tmp/cluster_tests@ directory in the node. If you want to run it, just ssh to the node, change to that directory and run:

<notextile>
<pre><code>cd /tmp/cluster_tests
sudo ./run-test.sh
</code></pre>
</notextile>

It will create a test user (by default, the same one as the admin user), upload a small workflow and run it. If everything goes OK, the output should similar to this (some output was shortened for clarity):
