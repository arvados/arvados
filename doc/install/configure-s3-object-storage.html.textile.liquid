Keepstore can store data in object storage compatible with the S3 API, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Ceph RADOS, NetApp StorageGRID, and others.

Volumes are configured in the @Volumes@ section of the cluster configuration file.

          # naming scheme to "012/0123456abc...". This can improve

h2(#IAM). IAM Policy

On Amazon, VMs which will access the S3 bucket (these include keepstore and compute nodes) will need an IAM policy with "permission that can read, write, list and delete objects in the bucket":https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html .  Here is an example policy:

<notextile>
<pre>
{
    "Id": "arvados-keepstore policy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                  "s3:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::xarv1-nyw5e-000000000000000-volume"
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::xarv1-nyw5e-000000000000000-volume/*"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
</notextile>
