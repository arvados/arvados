title: Install a shell server
...

This installation guide assumes you are on a 64 bit Debian or Ubuntu system.

There is nothing inherently special about an Arvados shell server. It is just a GNU/Linux machine with the Arvados SDKs installed. For optimal performance, the Arvados shell server should be on the same LAN as the Arvados cluster, but that is not required.

h2. Install API tokens

Please follow the "API token guide":{{site.baseurl}}/user/reference/api-tokens.html to get API tokens for your user and install them on your shell server. We will use those tokens to test the SDKs as we install them.

h2. Install the SDKs

Install the "Python SDK":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/python/sdk-python.html and the "Command line SDK":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/cli/install.html
