h2(#introduction). Introduction

The Keepproxy server is a gateway into your Keep storage. Unlike the Keepstore servers, which are only accessible on the local LAN, Keepproxy is suitable for clients located elsewhere on the internet. Specifically, in contrast to Keepstore:
* A client writing through Keepproxy sends a single copy of a data block, and Keepproxy distributes copies to the appropriate Keepstore servers.
* A client can write through Keepproxy without precomputing content hashes. Notably, the browser-based upload feature in Workbench requires Keepproxy.
* Keepproxy checks API token validity before processing requests. (Clients that can connect directly to Keepstore can use it as scratch space even without a valid API token.)

By convention, we use the following hostname for the Keepproxy server:

<div class="offset1">
table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Hostname|
|@keep.ClusterID.example.com@|
</div>

This hostname should resolve from anywhere on the internet.

h2(#update-config). Update config.yml

Edit the cluster config at @config.yml@ and set @Services.Keepproxy.ExternalURL@ and @Services.Keepproxy.InternalURLs@.

<notextile>
<pre><code>    Services:
      Keepproxy:
        ExternalURL: <span class="userinput">https://keep.ClusterID.example.com</span>
        InternalURLs:
          <span class="userinput">"http://localhost:25107": {}</span>
</span></code></pre>
</notextile>

h2(#update-nginx). Update Nginx configuration

Put a reverse proxy with SSL support in front of Keepproxy. Keepproxy itself runs on the port 25107 (or whatever is specified in @Services.Keepproxy.InternalURL@) while the reverse proxy runs on port 443 and forwards requests to Keepproxy.

Use a text editor to create a new file @/etc/nginx/conf.d/keepproxy.conf@ with the following configuration. Options that need attention are marked in <span class="userinput">red</span>.

<notextile><pre><code>upstream keepproxy {
  server                127.0.0.1:<span class="userinput">25107</span>;
}

server {
  listen                  443 ssl;
  server_name             <span class="userinput">keep.ClusterID.example.com</span>;

  proxy_connect_timeout   90s;
  proxy_read_timeout      300s;
  proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_http_version      1.1;
  proxy_request_buffering off;
  proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

  ssl_certificate     <span class="userinput">/YOUR/PATH/TO/cert.pem</span>;
  ssl_certificate_key <span class="userinput">/YOUR/PATH/TO/cert.key</span>;

  # Clients need to be able to upload blocks of data up to 64MiB in size.
  client_max_body_size    64m;

  location / {
    proxy_pass            http://keepproxy;
  }
}
</code></pre></notextile>

Note: if the Web uploader is failing to upload data and there are no logs from keepproxy, be sure to check the nginx proxy logs.  In addition to "GET" and "PUT", The nginx proxy must pass "OPTIONS" requests to keepproxy, which should respond with appropriate Cross-origin resource sharing headers.  If the CORS headers are not present, brower security policy will cause the upload request to silently fail.  The CORS headers are generated by keepproxy and should not be set in nginx.

h2(#confirm-working). Confirm working installation

Log into a host that is on a network external to your private Arvados network.  The host should be able to contact your keepproxy server (eg @keep.ClusterID.example.com@), but not your keepstore servers (eg keep[0-9].ClusterID.example.com).

@ARVADOS_API_HOST@ and @ARVADOS_API_TOKEN@ must be set in the environment.

@ARVADOS_API_HOST@ should be the hostname of the API server.

@ARVADOS_API_TOKEN@ should be the system root token.

Install the "Command line SDK":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/cli/install.html

Check that the keepproxy server is in the @keep_service@ "accessible" list:

<notextile>
<pre><code>
$ <span class="userinput">arv keep_service accessible</span>
[...]
</code></pre>
</notextile>

If keepstore does not show up in the "accessible" list, and you are accessing it from within the private network, check that you have "properly configured the @geo@ block for the API server":install-api-server.html#update-nginx .

Install the "Python SDK":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/python/sdk-python.html

You should now be able to use @arv-put@ to upload collections and @arv-get@ to fetch collections.  Be sure to execute this from _outside_ the cluster's private network.
