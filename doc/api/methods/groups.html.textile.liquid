API endpoint base: @https://{{ site.arvados_api_host }}/arvados/v1/groups@

Object type: @j7d0g@

Example UUID: @zzzzz-j7d0g-0123456789abcde@

h2. Resource

Groups provides a way to apply the same permissions to a set of Arvados objects.  See "permission model":{{site.baseurl}}/api/permission-model.html for details.

Each Group has, in addition to the "Common resource fields":{{site.baseurl}}/api/resources.html:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Attribute|_. Type|_. Description|_. Example|
|name|string|||
|group_class|string|Type of group. This does not affect behavior, but determines how the group is presented in the user interface. For example, @project@ indicates that the group should be displayed by Workbench and arv-mount as a project for organizing and naming objects.|@"project"@
null|
|description|text|||
|properties|hash|User-defined metadata, may be used in queries using "subproperty filters":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods.html#subpropertyfilters ||
|writable_by|array|List of UUID strings identifying Users and other Groups that have write permission for this Group.  Only users who are allowed to administer the Group will receive a full list.  Other users will receive a partial list that includes the Group's owner_uuid and (if applicable) their own user UUID.||
|trash_at|datetime|If @trash_at@ is non-null and in the past, this group and all objects directly or indirectly owned by the group will be hidden from API calls.  May be untrashed.||
|delete_at|datetime|If @delete_at@ is non-null and in the past, the group and all objects directly or indirectly owned by the group may be permanently deleted.||
|is_trashed|datetime|True if @trash_at@ is in the past, false if not.||

h2. Methods

See "Common resource methods":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods.html for more information about @create@, @delete@, @get@, @list@, and @update@.

Required arguments are displayed in %{background:#ccffcc}green%.

h3. contents

Retrieve a list of items owned by the group.

Arguments:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |
{background:#ccffcc}.|uuid|string|The UUID of the group in question.|path||
|limit|integer (default 100)|Maximum number of items to return.|query||
|order|array|Attributes to use as sort keys to determine the order resources are returned, each optionally followed by @asc@ or @desc@ to indicate ascending or descending order. Sort within a resource type by prefixing the attribute with the resource name and a period.|query|@["collections.modified_at desc"]@|
|filters|array|Conditions for filtering items.|query|@[["uuid", "is_a", "arvados#job"]]@|
|recursive|boolean (default false)|Include items owned by subprojects.|query|@true@|

Note: Because adding access tokens to manifests can be computationally expensive, the @manifest_text@ field is not included in listed collections.  If you need it, request a "list of collections":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods/collections.html with the filter @["owner_uuid", "=", GROUP_UUID]@, and @"manifest_text"@ listed in the select parameter.

Note: Use filters with the attribute format @<item type>.<field name>@ to filter items of a specific type. For example: @["pipeline_instances.state", "=", "Complete"]@ to filter @pipeline_instances@ where @state@ is @Complete@. All other types of items owned by this group will be unimpacted by this filter and will still be included.

h3. create

Create a new Group.

Arguments:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |

h3. delete

Put a Group in the trash.  This sets the @trash_at@ field to @now@ and @delete_at@ field to @now@ + token TTL.  A trashed group is invisible to most API calls unless the @include_trash@ parameter is true.  All objects directly or indirectly owned by the Group are considered trashed as well.

Arguments:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |
{background:#ccffcc}.|uuid|string|The UUID of the Group in question.|path||

h3. get

Gets a Group's metadata by UUID.

Arguments:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |
{background:#ccffcc}.|uuid|string|The UUID of the Group in question.|path||

h3. list

List groups.

See "common resource list method.":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods.html#index

h3. show

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |
{background:#ccffcc}.|uuid|string||path||

h3. update

{background:#ccffcc}.|uuid|string|The UUID of the Group in question.|path||

h3. untrash

Remove a Group from the trash.  This sets the @trash_at@ and @delete_at@ fields to @null@.

Arguments:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |
{background:#ccffcc}.|uuid|string|The UUID of the Group to untrash.|path||
|ensure_unique_name|boolean (default false)|Rename project uniquely if untrashing it would fail with a unique name conflict.|query||

h3. shared

This endpoint returns the toplevel set of groups to which access is granted through a chain of one or more permission links rather than through direct ownership by the current user account.  This is useful for clients which wish to browse the list of projects the user has permission to read which are not part of the "home" project tree.

When called with "include=owner_uuid" this also returns (in the "included" field) the objects that own those projects (users or non-project groups).

Specifically, the logic is:

<pre>
select groups that are readable by current user AND
    (the owner_uuid is a user (but not the current user) OR
     the owner_uuid is not readable by the current user OR
     the owner_uuid is a group but group_class is not a project)
</pre>

In addition to the "include" parameter this endpoint also supports the same parameters as the "list method.":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods.html#index

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |
|include|string|If provided with the value "owner_uuid", this will return owner objects in the "included" field of the response.|query|?include=owner_uuid|
