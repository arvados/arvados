API endpoint base: @https://{{ site.arvados_api_host }}/arvados/v1/computed_permissions@

h2. Resource

Computed permissions are entries from the internal cache of the highest permission level each user has on each permission target.

Each entry has the following attributes:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Attribute|_. Type|_. Description|
|user_uuid|string|An individual user.|
|target_uuid|string|An object (role group, project group, collection, etc.) on which the user has implicit or explicit permission.|
|perm_level|string|@can_read@, @can_write@, or @can_manage@|

There is only one row for a given (@user_uuid@, @target_uuid@) pair.

Computed permissions cannot be created or updated directly. To change permissions, use "groups":groups.html and "links":links.html APIs as described in the "permission model":../permission-model.html.
