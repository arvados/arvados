If you plan to use custom certificates, please set the variable <i>SSL_MODE=bring-your-own</i> and copy your certificates to the directory specified with the variable @CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR@ (usually "./certs") in the remote directory where you copied the @provision.sh@ script. From this dir, the provision script will install the certificates required for the role you're installing.

When using custom certificates in a single-host / single-hostname setup, the certificate and its key need to be copied to a file named after <i>${HOSTNAME_EXT}</i>. Ie., for "HOSTNAME_EXT='my-arvados.example.net', the script will lookup for
<notextile>
<pre><code>
# ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/my-arvados.example.net.crt
# ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/my-arvados.example.net.key
</code></pre>
</notextile>

For a setup with multiple hostnames, the script expects cert/key files with these basenames (matching the role except for <i>keepweb</i>, which is split in both <i>download / collections</i>):

* "controller"
* "websocket"
* "workbench"
* "workbench2"
* "webshell"
* "download"         # Part of keepweb
* "collections"      # Part of keepweb
* "keepproxy"

Ie., for 'keepproxy', the script will look for

<notextile>
<pre><code>${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.crt
${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.key
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Make sure that all the FQDNs that you will use for the public-facing applications (API/controller, Workbench, Keepproxy/Keepweb) are reachable.
