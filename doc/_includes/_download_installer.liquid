This procedure will install all the main Arvados components to get you up and running in a single host.

This is a package-based installation method, however the installation script is currently distributed in source form via @git@:

<notextile>
<pre><code>git clone https://git.arvados.org/arvados.git
git checkout {{ branchname }}
cd arvados/tools/salt-install
</code></pre>
</notextile>

The @provision.sh@ script will help you deploy Arvados by preparing your environment to be able to run the installer, then running it. The actual installer is located in the "arvados-formula git repository":https://git.arvados.org/arvados-formula.git/tree/refs/heads/{{ branchname }} and will be cloned during the running of the @provision.sh@ script.  The installer is built using "Saltstack":https://saltproject.io/ and @provision.sh@ performs the install using master-less mode.
