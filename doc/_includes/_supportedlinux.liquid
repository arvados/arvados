Arvados packages are published for current Debian releases (until the EOL date), current Ubuntu LTS releases (until the end of standard support), and the latest version of Red Hat Enterpise Linux (RHEL) and compatible distributions such as Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux.

Please note that starting from 2.7.4 Arvados no longer supports CentOS 7.  CentOS 7 reached end-of-life on June 30, 2024.  As a result, upstream support infrastructure required for us to build Arvados packages for CentOS 7 is no longer available.
