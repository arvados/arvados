You will need certificates for each DNS name and DNS wildcard previously described in the "Hosts":#hosts .

To simplify certificate management, we recommend creating a single certificate with all of the hostnames, or creating a wildcard certificate that covers all possible hostnames (with the following patterns in subjectAltName):

<pre>
xarv1.example.com
*.xarv1.example.com
*.collections.xarv1.example.com
</pre>

(Replacing xarv1 with your own ${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN})

Copy your certificates to the directory specified with the variable @CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR@ in the remote directory where you copied the @provision.sh@ script. The provision script will find the certificates there.

The script expects cert/key files with these basenames (matching the role except for <i>keepweb</i>, which is split in both <i>download / collections</i>):

# @controller@
# @websocket@        # note: corresponds to default domain @ws.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN}@
# @keepproxy@        # note: corresponds to default domain @keep.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN}@
# @download@         # Part of keepweb
# @collections@      # Part of keepweb -- important note, this should be a wildcard for @*.collections.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN}@
# @workbench@
# @workbench2@
# @webshell@

For example, for the 'keepproxy' service the script will expect to find this certificate:

<notextile>
<pre><code>${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.crt
${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.key
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Make sure that all the FQDNs that you will use for the public-facing applications (API/controller, Workbench, Keepproxy/Keepweb) are reachable.

Note: because the installer currently looks for a different certificate file for each service, if you use a single certificate, we recommend creating a symlink for each certificate and key file to the primary certificate and key, e.g.

<notextile>
<pre><code>ln -s xarv1.crt ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.crt
ln -s xarv1.key ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.key
</code></pre>
</notextile>
