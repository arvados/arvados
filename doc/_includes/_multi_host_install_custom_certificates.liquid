Copy your certificates to the directory specified with the variable @CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR@ in the remote directory where you copied the @provision.sh@ script. The provision script will find the certificates there.

The script expects cert/key files with these basenames (matching the role except for <i>keepweb</i>, which is split in both <i>download / collections</i>):

* "controller"
* "websocket"
* "workbench"
* "workbench2"
* "webshell"
* "download"         # Part of keepweb
* "collections"      # Part of keepweb
* "keepproxy"

E.g. for 'keepproxy', the script will look for

<notextile>
<pre><code>${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.crt
${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.key
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Make sure that all the FQDNs that you will use for the public-facing applications (API/controller, Workbench, Keepproxy/Keepweb) are reachable.
