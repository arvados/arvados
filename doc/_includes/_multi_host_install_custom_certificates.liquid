You will need certificates for each DNS name and DNS wildcard previously listed in the "DNS hostnames for each service":#DNS .

To simplify certificate management, we recommend creating a single certificate for all of the hostnames, or creating a wildcard certificate that covers all possible hostnames (with the following patterns in subjectAltName):

<pre>
xarv1.example.com
*.xarv1.example.com
*.collections.xarv1.example.com
</pre>

(Replacing @xarv1.example.com@ with your own @${DOMAIN}@)

Copy your certificates to the directory specified with the variable @CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR@ in the remote directory where you copied the @provision.sh@ script. The provision script will find the certificates there.

The script expects cert/key files with these basenames (matching the role except for <i>keepweb</i>, which is split in both <i>download / collections</i>):

# @balancer@         -- Optional on multi-node installations
# @collections@      -- Part of keepweb, must be a wildcard for @*.collections.${DOMAIN}@
# @controller@
# @download@         -- Part of keepweb
# @grafana@          -- Service available by default on multi-node installations
# @keepproxy@        -- Corresponds to default domain @keep.${DOMAIN}@
# @prometheus@       -- Service available by default on multi-node installations
# @webshell@
# @websocket@        -- Corresponds to default domain @ws.${DOMAIN}@
# @workbench@
# @workbench2@

For example, for the @keepproxy@ service the script will expect to find this certificate:

<notextile>
<pre><code>${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.crt
${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.key
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Make sure that all the FQDNs that you will use for the public-facing applications (API/controller, Workbench, Keepproxy/Keepweb) are reachable.

Note: because the installer currently looks for a different certificate file for each service, if you use a single certificate, we recommend creating a symlink for each certificate and key file to the primary certificate and key, e.g.

<notextile>
<pre><code class="userinput">ln -s xarv1.crt ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/controller.crt
ln -s xarv1.key ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/controller.key
ln -s xarv1.crt ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.crt
ln -s xarv1.key ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keepproxy.key
...
</code></pre>
</notextile>
