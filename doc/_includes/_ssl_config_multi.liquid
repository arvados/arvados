h2(#certificates). Choose the SSL/TLS configuration (SSL_MODE)

Arvados requires a valid TLS certificate to work correctly. This installer supports these options:

# @lets-encrypt@: "automatically obtain and install an SSL certificates for your hostnames":#lets-encrypt
# @bring-your-own@: "supply your own certificates in the @certs@ directory":#bring-your-own

h3(#lets-encrypt). Using a Let's Encrypt certificate

In the default configuration, this installer gets a valid certificate via Let's Encrypt. If you have the <b>CLUSTER.DOMAIN</b> domain in a route53 zone, you can set <b>USE_LETSENCRYPT_ROUTE53</b> to <b>YES</b> and supply appropriate credentials so that Let's Encrypt can use dns-01 validation to get the appropriate certificates.

<notextile>
<pre><code>SSL_MODE="lets-encrypt"
USE_LETSENCRYPT_ROUTE53="yes"
LE_AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
LE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ"
LE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="thisistherandomstringthatisyoursecretkey"
</code></pre>
</notextile>

Please note that when using AWS, EC2 instances can have a default hostname that ends with <i>amazonaws.com</i>. Let's Encrypt has a blacklist of domain names for which it will not issue certificates, and that blacklist includes the <i>amazonaws.com</i> domain, which means the default hostname can not be used to get a certificate from Let's Encrypt.

h3(#bring-your-own). Bring your own certificates

To supply your own certificates, change the configuration like this:

<notextile>
<pre><code>SSL_MODE="bring-your-own"
</code></pre>
</notextile>

{% include 'multi_host_install_custom_certificates' %}

All certificate files will be used by nginx. You may need to include intermediate certificates in your certificate files. See "the nginx documentation":http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html#chains for more details.
