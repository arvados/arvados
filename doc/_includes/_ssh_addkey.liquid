h3. From the Workbench dashboard

If you have no SSH keys registered, there should be a notification asking you to provide your SSH public key.  In the Workbench top navigation menu, look for a dropdown menu with your email address in upper right corner. It will have an icon such as <span class="badge badge-alert">1</span> (the number indicates there are new notifications).  Click on this icon and a dropdown menu should appear with a message asking you to add your public key.  Paste your public key into the text area provided and click on the check button to submit the key.  You are now ready to "log into an Arvados VM":#login.

h3. Alternate way to add SSH keys

Click on the link with your _email address_ in the upper right corner to access the user settings menu, and click on the menu item *Manage account* to go to the account management page.

On the *Manage account* page, click on the button <span class="btn btn-primary">*+* Add new SSH key</span> button in the upper right corner of the page in the SSH Keys panel.

This will open a popup as shown in this screenshot:

Paste the public key that you copied to the cliboard in the previous section into the popup text box labeled *Public Key* and click on the <span class="btn btn-primary">Submit</span> button to save it. This should refresh the Manage account page with the fingerprint of the public key that you just added in the SSH Keys panel.  You are now ready to "log into an Arvados VM":#login.

To see a list of virtual machines that you have access to and determine the name and login information, click on the link with your _email address_ in the upper right corner and click on the menu item *Manage account* to go to the account management page. On this page, you will see a *Virtual Machines* panel, which lists the virtual machines you can access. The *hostname* column lists the name of each available VM.  The *logins* column will have a list of comma separated values of the form @you@. In this guide the hostname will be *_shell_* and the login will be *_you_*.  Replace these with your hostname and login name as appropriate.
