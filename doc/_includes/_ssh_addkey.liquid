If you have no SSH keys registered, there should be a notification asking you to provide your SSH public key.  In the Workbench top navigation menu, look for a dropdown menu with your email address in upper right corner. It will have an icon such as <span class="badge badge-alert">1</span> (the number indicates there are new notifications).  Click on this icon and a dropdown menu should appear with a message asking you to add your public key.  Paste your public key into the text area provided and click on the check button to submit the key.  You are now ready to "log into an Arvados VM":#login.

If you want to add more SSH keys, click on the link with your _email address_ in the upper right corner to access the user settings menu, and click on the menu item *Manage ssh keys* to go to the Authorized keys page.

On the *Authorized keys* page, the click on the button <span class="btn btn-primary disabled">Add a new authorized key</span> in the upper right corner.

A new authorized key will be added and you will be taken to the key's page. Towards the bottom of this page you will see the *public_key* attribute. Click on the cell +New authorized key+.  This will open an editing popup as shown in this screenshot:

!{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ssh-adding-public-key.png!

Paste the public key that you copied to the cliboard in the previous section into the popup text box, then click on the check mark to save it.  This should refresh the page with the public key that you just added as the *public_key* attribute value.  You are now ready to "log into an Arvados VM":#login.
