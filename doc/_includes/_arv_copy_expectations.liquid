As stated above, arv-copy is recursive by default and requires a working git repository in the destination cluster. If you do not have a repository created, you can follow the "Adding a new repository":{{site.baseurl}}/user/tutorials/add-new-repository.html page. We will use the *tutorial* repository created in that page as the example.

<br/>In addition, arv-copy requires git when copying to a git repository. Please make sure that git is installed and available.
