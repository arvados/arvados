h2. Configure FUSE

FUSE must be configured with the @user_allow_other@ option enabled for Crunch to set up Keep mounts that are readable by containers.  Install this file as @/etc/fuse.conf@:

<notextile>
<pre>
# Set the maximum number of FUSE mounts allowed to non-root users.
# The default is 1000.
#
#mount_max = 1000

# Allow non-root users to specify the 'allow_other' or 'allow_root'
# mount options.
#
user_allow_other
</pre>
</notextile>
