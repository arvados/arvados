# SSL CERTIFICATES
# Arvados REQUIRES valid SSL to work correctly. Otherwise, some components will fail
# to communicate and can silently drop traffic. You can try to use the Letsencrypt
# salt formula (https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/letsencrypt-formula) to try to
# automatically obtain and install SSL certificates for your instances or set this
# variable to "no", provide and upload your own certificates to the instances and
# modify the 'nginx_*' salt pillars accordingly (see CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR below)
USE_LETSENCRYPT="yes"
USE_LETSENCRYPT_IAM_USER="yes"
# For collections, we need to obtain a wildcard certificate for
# '*.collections.<cluster>.<domain>'. This is only possible through a DNS-01 challenge.
# For that reason, you'll need to provide AWS credentials with permissions to manage
# RRs in the route53 zone for the cluster.
# WARNING!: If AWS credentials files already exist in the hosts, they won't be replaced.
LE_AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
LE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ"
LE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="thisistherandomstringthatisyoursecretkey"

# If you going to provide your own certificates for Arvados, the provision script can
# help you deploy them. In order to do that, you need to set `USE_LETSENCRYPT=no` above,
# and copy the required certificates under the directory specified in the next line.
# The certs will be copied from this directory by the provision script.
# Plese set it to the FULL PATH to the certs dir if you're going to use a different dir
# CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR="${SCRIPT_DIR}/certs"
# The script expects cert/key files with these basenames (matching the role except for
# keepweb, which is split in both downoad/collections):
#  "controller"
#  "websocket"
#  "workbench"
#  "workbench2"
#  "webshell"
#  "download"         # Part of keepweb
#  "collections"      # Part of keepweb
#  "keep"             # Keepproxy
# Ie., 'keep', the script will lookup for
# ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keep.crt
# ${CUSTOM_CERTS_DIR}/keep.key

# The directory to check for the config files (pillars, states) you want to use.
# There are a few examples under 'config_examples'.

# These are ARVADOS-related settings.
# Which release of Arvados repo you want to use
RELEASE="production"
# Which version of Arvados you want to install. Defaults to latest stable
# VERSION="2.1.2-1"

# This is an arvados-formula setting.
# If branch is set, the script will switch to it before running salt
# Usually not needed, only used for testing
