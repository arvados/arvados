Prerequisites
=============

In order to build packages, you will need:

* Ansible installed following the instructions in `tools/ansible/README.md`
* `ansible-galaxy` and `ansible-playbook` in `$PATH` (e.g., by activating
  your Ansible virtualenv, or having symlinks to those commands inside it)
* Docker installed
* permission to run Docker commands
* the `WORKSPACE` environment variable set to the absolute path of an
  Arvados Git work tree

The Ansible playbook `tools/ansible/install-dev-tools.yml` can install all
of these prerequisites except the last.

Quickstart
==========

Build and test all the packages for a distribution on your architecture by
running:

    ./run-build-test-packages-one-target.sh --target DISTRO

This will build package build and test Docker images for the named target
distribution, build all packages in a build container, then test all
packages in a test container.

Limit the build to a single package by adding the `--only-build
PACKAGE_NAME` option. This is helpful when a build is mostly in good shape
and you're tracking down last bugs in one or two packages.

Get more verbose output by adding the `--debug` option.

By default the script avoids rebuilding or retesting packages that it
detects have already been done in past runs. You can force the script to
rebuild or retest package(s) with the `--force-build` and `--force-test`
options, respectively.

Run the script with `--help` for more information about other options.

Scripts in this directory
=========================

run-tests.sh                             Run unit and integration test suite.

run-build-packages.sh                    Actually build packages.  Intended to run
                                         inside Docker container with proper
                                         build environment.

run-build-packages-python-and-ruby.sh    Build Python and Ruby packages suitable
                                         for upload to PyPi and Rubygems.

run-build-docker-images.sh               Build arvbox Docker images.

run-library.sh                           A library of functions shared by the
                                         various scripts in this
                                         directory.

build_docker_image.py                    Build a Docker image from Arvados
                                         source components

Adding a new target
===================

In order to build packages on a new distribution, you MUST:

* Define containers to build the package build and test Docker images in
  `tools/ansible/files/development-docker-images.yml`.
* Create `package-testing/test-packages-TARGET.sh`, ideally by making it a
  symlink to `FORMAT-common-test-packages.sh`.
* Update the package download code near the bottom of `test_package_presence`
  in `run-library.sh` so it can download packages for the new distribution.

Of course, any part of our package build or test infrastructure may need to
be updated to accommodate the process for new distributions. If you're
having trouble building lots of packages, consider grepping these build
scripts for the identifier of the closest working target, and see if you may
need to add branches or similar hooks for your target. If you're having
trouble building specific packages, consider doing the same for those
packages' `fpm-info.sh` files.
