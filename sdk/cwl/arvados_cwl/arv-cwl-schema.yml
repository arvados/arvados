      local_output_dir: Use regular file system local to the compute node.
      There must be sufficient local scratch space to store entire output;
      specify this with `outdirMin` of `ResourceRequirement`.  Files are
      batch uploaded to Keep when the process completes.  Most compatible, but
      upload step can be time consuming for very large files.
    - |
      keep_output_dir: Use writable Keep mount.  Files are streamed to Keep as
      they are written.  Does not consume local scratch space, but does consume
      RAM for output buffers (up to 192 MiB per file simultaneously open for
      writing.)  Best suited to processes which produce sequential output of
      large files (non-sequential writes may produced fragmented file
      manifests).  Supports regular files and directories, does not support
      special files such as symlinks, hard links, named pipes, named sockets,
      or device nodes.

        Size of file data buffer for Keep mount in MiB. Default is 256
        MiB. Increase this to reduce cache thrashing in situations such as
        accessing multiple large (64+ MiB) files at the same time, or
        performing random access on a large file.

    outputTTL:
      type: int
      doc: |
        If the value is greater than zero, consider intermediate output
        collections to be temporary and should be automatically
        trashed. Temporary collections will be trashed `outputTTL` seconds
        after creation.  A value of zero means intermediate output should be
        retained indefinitely (this is the default behavior).

        Note: arvados-cwl-runner currently does not take workflow dependencies
        into account when setting the TTL on an intermediate output
        collection. If the TTL is too short, it is possible for a collection to
        be trashed before downstream steps that consume it are started.  The
        recommended minimum value for TTL is the expected duration of the
        entire the workflow.
