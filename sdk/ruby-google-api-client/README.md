# Arvados Google API Client

This is a fork of the google-api-client gem, based on https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client version 0.8.6.

It adds compatibility fixes for newer versions of dependencies (Ruby, faraday, etc.) while avoiding the breaking API changes that have been made in the upstream project.

It is entirely focused on the use cases needed by the Arvados Ruby SDK and is not intended or expected to work elsewhere.
