"""Utilities to retry operations.

The core of this module is `RetryLoop`, a utility class to retry operations
that might fail. It can distinguish between temporary and permanent failures;
provide exponential backoff; and save a series of results.

It also provides utility functions for common operations with `RetryLoop`:

* `check_http_response_success` can be used as a `RetryLoop` `success_check`
  for HTTP response codes from the Arvados API server.
* `retry_method` can decorate methods to provide a default `num_retries`
  keyword argument.

    """Coordinate limited retries of code.

    `RetryLoop` coordinates a loop that runs until it records a
    successful result or tries too many times, whichever comes first.
    Typical use looks like:

        loop = RetryLoop(num_retries=2)
        for tries_left in loop:
            try:
                result = do_something()

    : The maximum number of times to retry the loop if it
      doesn't succeed.  This means the loop body could run at most
      `num_retries + 1` times.

    success_check: Callable
    : This is a function that will be called each
      time the loop saves a result.  The function should return
      `True` if the result indicates the code succeeded, `False` if it
      represents a permanent failure, and `None` if it represents a
      temporary failure.  If no function is provided, the loop will
      end after any result is saved.

    backoff_start: float
    : The number of seconds that must pass before the loop's second
      iteration.  Default 0, which disables all waiting.

    backoff_growth: float
    : The wait time multiplier after each iteration.
      Default 2 (i.e., double the wait time each time).

    save_results: int
    : Specify a number to store that many saved results from the loop.
      These are available through the `results` attribute, oldest first.
      Default 1.
