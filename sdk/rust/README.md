# Rust sdk for Arvados

Currently [issue 16867](https://dev.arvados.org/issues/16867)

The Aravdos Rust sdk is and interface to the REST API exposed
by Aravdos servers and the Keep services that manage the data.

The API itself is generated by the JSON returned by any Aravdos API
server and local configuration files.

For an example of this, see Rusoto, the AWS SDK.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, install rust using rustup:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then run:

```
cargo test
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create arvados-api-generator and aravados-client crates.
- [ ] Parse API JSON and generate blank client.
- [ ] Construct a build.rs that generates the client on changes to the JSON.
- [ ] Generate tests from the JSON and run them.
- [ ] Update client to make requests via async reqwest.
- [ ] Build CI tests and run them or integrate with existing Aravdos tests.
- [ ] Expand the CI tests to Windows and OSX platforms.
- [ ] Implement Keep Service logic.
- [ ] Review process.
- [ ] Merge to main branch.
